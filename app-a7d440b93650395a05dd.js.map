For example, the CSS language definition\n       * not only defines CSS highlighting for CSS documents, but also needs to define highlighting for CSS embedded\n       * in HTML through `<style>` elements. To do this, it needs to modify `Prism.languages.markup` and add the\n       * appropriate tokens. However, `Prism.languages.markup` is a regular JavaScript object literal, so if you do\n       * this:\n       *\n       * ```js\n       * Prism.languages.markup.style = {\n       *     // token\n       * };\n       * ```\n       *\n       * then the `style` token will be added (and processed) at the end. `insertBefore` allows you to insert tokens\n       * before existing tokens. For the CSS example above, you would use it like this:\n       *\n       * ```js\n       * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'cdata', {\n       *     'style': {\n       *         // token\n       *     }\n       * });\n       * ```\n       *\n       * ## Special cases\n       *\n       * If the grammars of `inside` and `insert` have tokens with the same name, the tokens in `inside`'s grammar\n       * will be ignored.\n       *\n       * This behavior can be used to insert tokens after `before`:\n       *\n       * ```js\n       * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', {\n       *     'comment': Prism.languages.markup.comment,\n       *     // tokens after 'comment'\n       * });\n       * ```\n       *\n       * ## Limitations\n       *\n       * The main problem `insertBefore` has to solve is iteration order. Since ES2015, the iteration order for object\n       * properties is guaranteed to be the insertion order (except for integer keys) but some browsers behave\n       * differently when keys are deleted and re-inserted. So `insertBefore` can't be implemented by temporarily\n       * deleting properties which is necessary to insert at arbitrary positions.\n       *\n       * To solve this problem, `insertBefore` doesn't actually insert the given tokens into the target object.\n       * Instead, it will create a new object and replace all references to the target object with the new one. This\n       * can be done without temporarily deleting properties, so the iteration order is well-defined.\n       *\n       * However, only references that can be reached from `Prism.languages` or `insert` will be replaced.

requires version of react that has implementatoin baked in.\n  \n  Package source is using ES modules:\n    - https://github.com/jamiebuilds/create-react-context/blob/v0.3.0/src/index.js\n  \n  But to build this package `babel-plugin-add-module-exports` is used ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-add-module-exports).\n  Which result in both `module.exports` and `exports.default` being set to same thing.\n\n  We don't use that babel plugin so we only have `exports.default`.\n\n  This cause problems in various 3rd party react components that rely on `module.exports` being set.\n  See https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/23645 for example of it.\n  \n  Instead of adding same babel plugin we mimic output here. Adding babel plugin just for this would:\n   a) unnecesairly slow down compilation for all other files (if we just apply it everywhere)\n   b) or complicate babel-loader configuration with overwrite specifically for this file\n*/\n\nconst { createContext } = require(`react`)\n\nmodule.exports = createContext\nmodule.exports.default = createContext\n","var id = 0;\nvar postfix = Math.random();\n\nmodule.exports = function (key) {\n  return 'Symbol(' + String(key === undefined ?
