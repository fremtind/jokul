    Let's create a comprehensive project and deliver all the secrets of Google Maps + TypeScript + React? This is the first blog of Google Maps tutorial series with a course video.
</Ingress>

Coding with Google Maps is a fun, mysterious and challenging journey. If you do it with Typescript, both joy and pain get doubled.

When I was coding a Google Maps component at Fremtind, I was starving for a comprehensive tutorial on this topic. Unfortunately, the results were a bit disappointing, but like all developers I found a solution for each problem and the job was done. Then I asked to myself: Why not creating a comprehensive project and delivering all the secrets of my journey in one post?

While I was working on my map component, I discovered the answers to my questions via different websites. For example:

- How can I use TypeScript types from Google for my map project in React?
- How should I load my Google Maps API script into my homepage? What could be the best practice?
- Where should I use `useRef` to point out my Google Maps DOM element?

Some of the answers that I found were outdated, some people were not quite sure of what they were advising, etcâ€¦ You know the drill.

As a result, I created a sample project on GitHub and decided to sail for a new adventure as well. For the first time, I screencast while coding. The video is 55 minutes long and you can see the whole process.

### Setup and Installation
To kick off the project, we need to create a react application with typescript flag. Use the sample command below to start with:

```npm
npx create-react-app google-maps --template typescript
```

After removing files like `logo.svg` and `App.test.tsx`, run the command below to install Google Maps TypeScript types. This will help you access types from the `google.maps` namespace such as `google.maps.Map`, `google.maps.LatLng`, and so on.

```npm
npm install --save-dev @types/googlemaps
```

*Bonus Hint*: By doing so, you will also obtain google.maps.places.AutocompletePrediction type which can be used to build an address dropdown component.

Now we are ready to give a shape to our React project. I set up the file and folder structure of my src folder as blueprinted below:

â”œâ”€â”€ App.css<br/>
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx<br/>
â”œâ”€â”€ Map<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â”œâ”€â”€ Map.scss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â”œâ”€â”€ Map.tsx<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â””â”€â”€ index.ts<br/>
â”œâ”€â”€ index.css<br/>
â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx<br/>
â”œâ”€â”€ react-app-env.d.ts<br/>
â””â”€â”€ utils<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â””â”€â”€ GoogleMapsUtils.ts<br/>

### Loading the Google Maps library

While developing a Google Maps component, we need to load the script tag which will download the API library for us. At the end, our web page should show something like this:

```html
<script
src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=<YOUR_API_KEY>&libraries=places&language=no&region=NO&v=quarterly"
async defer>
</script>
```
Before loading this tag into our DOM structure, we cannot run Google Maps related code pieces. Therefore, we should create a utility function under `utils/GoogleMapsUtils.ts`.

```typescript
export const loadMapApi = () => {
    const mapsURL = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=${process.env.REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}&libraries=geometry,places&language=no&region=NO&v=quarterly`;
    const scripts = document.getElementsByTagName('script');
    // Go through existing script tags, and return google maps api tag when found.
    for (let i = 0; i < scripts.length; i++) {
        if (scripts[i].src.indexOf(mapsURL) === 0) {
            return scripts[i];
        }
    }

    const googleMapScript = document.createElement('script');
    googleMapScript.src = mapsURL;
    googleMapScript.async = true;
    googleMapScript.defer = true;
    window.document.body.appendChild(googleMapScript);

    return googleMapScript;
};
```

This function creates the aforementioned script tag and inserts it into the DOM if it is not found. `loadMapApi()` will be used by the page which uses our Map component. In my example, this page will be the homepage of the project (`App.tsx`).

### Making the app ready for maps

In this application, we have two fundamental tasks for `App.tsx`. The first is to load the map utility, and the second is to render our Map component. To do the first, I created the React hook below:

```typescript
const [scriptLoaded, setScriptLoaded] = useState(false);
```

This hook makes sure that Google Maps script tag is loaded successfully into the page. When scriptLoaded hook is set true we render the Map component.

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
    const googleMapScript = loadMapApi();
    googleMapScript.addEventListener('load', function () {
        setScriptLoaded(true);
    });
}, []);
```


```typescript
return (
    <div className="App">
        {scriptLoaded && (
            <Map
              mapType={google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP}
              mapTypeControl={true}
            />
        )}
    </div>
);
```

### Time to render the map
We finally reached to the heart of the application. `Map.tsx` is the component I mentioned earlier. Letâ€™s create its interface (`IMap`) first.

```typescript
interface IMap {
    mapType: google.maps.MapTypeId;
    mapTypeControl?: boolean;
}
```

I wanted to receive two basic props. mapType can have ROADMAP, SATELLITE, TERRAIN or HYBRID values. These are specific map types defined by Google.

![Roadmap Example](/assets/blog/google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP.png)

![Satellite Example](/assets/blog/google.maps.MapTypeId.SATELLITE.png)

<br/>
<p>And we will use mapTypeControl prop to show/hide the control menu on the left-top corner of your map. We may extend the number of props to increase the usability of our map component, but I wanted to use only two props to illustrate my example.</p>

<p>I also use typescriptâ€™s custom type definition feature to increase the readability of my source code.</p>

```typescript
type GoogleLatLng = google.maps.LatLng;
type GoogleMap = google.maps.Map;
```

Before I explain the `initMap`, `defaultMapStart`, and `startMap` functions, I would like to show you the render part of the Map component.

```typescript
const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

return (
    <div className="map-container">
        <div ref={ref} className="map-container__map"></div>
    </div>
);
```

The inner div element is the reference point for Google Maps. The API will load my map content into this div element and I use the outer div just for styling purposes. On the other hand, the same ref value is used by initMap function where the map is triggered.

```typescript
const initMap = (zoomLevel: number, address: GoogleLatLng): void => {
    if (ref.current) {
        setMap(
            new google.maps.Map(ref.current, {
                zoom: zoomLevel,
                center: address,
                mapTypeControl: mapTypeControl,
                streetViewControl: false,
                rotateControl: false,
                scaleControl: true,
                fullscreenControl: false,
                panControl: false,
                zoomControl: true,
                gestureHandling: 'cooperative',
                mapTypeId: mapType,
                draggableCursor: 'pointer',
            })
        );
    }
};
```

As you see above, before implementing the initMap function, I created a hook called **map**. This hook is used to keep the map object created by google.maps.Map(â€¦) function. The same function takes our div element via ref.current as its first parameter and the second parameter is a json object which keeps the preferences of our map.

initMap receives two inputs: *zoomLevel* and *address*. zoomLevel is straightforward to understand, but what address does will be more clear when we take a look at **defaultMapStart()** function.

```typescript
const defaultMapStart = (): void => {
    const defaultAddress = new google.maps.LatLng(65.166013499, 13.3698147);
    initMap(4, defaultAddress);
};
```

So, this function basically calls the initMap, but it also does some critical work as well. It decides where to focus and how much to focus when our map starts.

```typescript
const startMap = (): void => {
    if (!map) {
        defaultMapStart();
    }
};
useEffect(startMap, [map]);
```

Finally, **startMap** function calls defaultMapStart() when the map hook is not null anymore. This check is necessary because of rendering delays and typescript will complain if you do not run this check.

### Conclusion
This application may not seem so impressive in terms of functionality, but you see that we had to do a lot of things just to start our map. While shooting the video, I had a problem with the API key because I did not want to screencast it via my youtube video, but when I include it, the output is as shown below:
