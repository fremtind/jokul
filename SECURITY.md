# Security

## Responsible disclosure

We use GitHub's [Private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)-feature. 

If you prefer, you may contact us privately via e-mail on fremtind.designsystem@fremtind.no

## Supported Versions

- We release new versions automatically on merge.
- We usually do not patch older major versions, but may make exceptions for security fixes.
- We do our best to release security updates without breaking changes.
